hft is a small project with a big ambition. We aim to build the worlds best
algorithmic trading platform using the best off-the-shelf open source
technology stack to be found.

hft is created and maintained by [Tony Day](http://scarcecapital.com).

Some near-term goals include:
- moving the project to an organization basis (which will involve a name
  change (watch this space).
- installing a modern communication toolkit

  apply to the hft problem domain.
